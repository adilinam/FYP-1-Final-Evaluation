<h1>Operational QVT Code Coverage View</h1>
<p>
A screenshot of the Operational QVT Code Coverage View is given in the figure below.

</p>

<p>
The view is created and gains focus once execution of a JUnit test suite is completed. The left column 
of the coverage view shows a hierarchical view of transformations that were invoked during the test run, 
with project on top and the transformation modules and library units within the project underneath, in 
this case only the <i>Hello World</i> module. The remaining columns show the coverage criteria per QVTo 
language construct used within the unit. Each cell contains the achieved coverage percentage of the 
corresponding coverage criteria, as well as the absolute values that were used to calculate it. 
</p> 

<p>
The coverage view cells are colored according to the percentage calculated for that criterion; 
high coverage (green), medium coverage (white) and low coverage (red). The two thressholds required
to categorize the coverage value can be configured in the workspace preferences, 
see <i>Windows->Preferences->Operational QVT Code Coverage</i>. By default, the high coverage thresshold is set to
90%, the low coverage thresshold is set to 30%.
</p>

<p>
Easy navigation to the transformation module or library unit is offered by double clicking on it when
listed in the view. The module or libary is opened in the associated editor. An example is shown 
in the figure below.

<h2>Clear coverage data</h2>
<p>
The toolbar of the Operational QVT Code Coverage View contains a button to clear the coverage data collected 
during previous runs. By pressing the button, the view as well as the markers that were set on instrumented
transformation modules are cleared.
